# Bookmarklet generator

This Svelte project is designed to help you generate bookmarklets with compression support quickly and easily.

Bookmarklets are small scripts that you can run directly from your browser's bookmarks bar, allowing you to execute specific actions or commands with just one click. With this project, you can easily create your own bookmarklets, customize them to suit your needs, and save them to your bookmarks bar for future use. The best part is that all the data is stored directly in the URL, so you can easily edit or update your bookmarklet by simply updating the URL.

You can try it at [bookmarklet.jose.gr](https://bookmarklet.jose.gr)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab

```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
